# Portfolio

## Description

This is the second draft of Susanna Skornicka's professional portfolio for web design. It features a section to highlight work, and 'about me' sention and a 'contact me' section. All of these sections are linked from the header to the appropriate part of the website. I do not yet have any projects to display so there are only placeholders. Special attention was made to make the site responsive to many viewport sizes. 

## Usage

This portfolio will continuously be enhanced with further learning in the boot camp. It will be used to showcase to future employers the skills and past work prduced. The ' contact me section contains liks that allow for easy emial, telephone contact, and link to my Linked in profile.
